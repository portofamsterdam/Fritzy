Fritzy2.0: A Showcase For Decentral Organisation Of Industrial Energy

Uitgangspunten
• Learn by experiment.
• Real: the essence, as simple a possible.
• Interesting: easily understandable.
• Experimental: easily adjustable.
• Contagious: easy to connect.

Fritzy2.0 consists of four devices which locally trade energy to avoid congestion on the energy network while also getting a better deal for the energy price. The devices are a fridge (Fritzy), a PV installation (Sunny), a battery (Batty) and a net connection (Exxy). The devices trade energy among themselves to avoid buying energy from the net which is simulated by Exxy. All actors have to comply by the rules set by the net provider which is simulated by Netty. Netty can be configured to reduce the available amount of capacity on the network, forcing local trade. Netty can also stimulate local trade by giving rewards to local traders. 

Prerequisites
Docker <TODO version>
Gradle 4.9

Build
In this repo are five docker applications which can be built with the following commands.   
$ cd gradle/
$ ./gradlew.sh copyArtifactsToDocker
$ cd ../docker/build/fritzy
$ docker build -t fritzy2/fritzy:fritzy .
$ cd ../batty
$ docker build -t fritzy2/fritzy:batty .
$ cd ../netty
$ docker build -t fritzy2/fritzy:netty .
$ cd ../sunny
$ docker build -t fritzy2/fritzy:sunny .
$ cd ../exxy
$ docker build -t fritzy2/fritzy:exxy .

The images can be run individually by setting the correct config directory. The images are run as part of Fritzy with the Docker compose file in <TODO set fritzy git url>.

Device

Each device is responsible for controlling its own hardware and trading. The device and trading mechanisms are separated by the Efi standard (see below) which makes devices and trading algorithms more portable.

FritzyApi

Each device trades on the market using the fritzy api. It connect to a blockchain market for trading energy. Every actor is allowed to mint and burn energy on the market. Energy minted should be used (burned) or sold in a given trade period. For now trade periods are a set 15 minutes. In a trading period energy is bought and sold for the next 15 minute period. E.g. energy sold between 11:30 and 11:45 is used or generated by the device between 11:45 and 12:00. Euro tokens should be created for the devices which have to buy energy like the fridge.  

Efi

Devices express their energy requirements using Efi messages. This way trading algorithms can be built on a standard set of Efi messages and reused for multiple devices following similar energy patterns. 

The standard is currently awaiting approval to become european standard:
